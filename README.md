# MainProject_MachineLearningSolutions
In this repository you will find all the codes, dataset, google colab notebooks that were created/used for this project.

This was done in order to come up with solutions using 3 types of machine learning algorithms: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

To run the codes from the reinforcement learning section, you would need to run these commands to install the necessary libraries:
pip install gym numpy
pip install gym

#Contents of the repository

The initial proposal of the project is in the file 'Project Proposal'

The datasets includes the files of the sensor readings, datos_robot and all_data.

The first delivery of the project which includes the supervised learning solution includes a notebook and a report of the process.

The final delivery includes the notebook of the unsupervised learning, and the codes for the reinforcement learning, which are agent, train and environment.

Everything is compressed in the zip file called Main_Project
