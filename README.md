# MainProject_MachineLearningSolutions
In this repository you will find all the codes, dataset, google colab notebooks that were created/used for this project.

This was done in order to come up with solutions using 3 types of machine learning algorithms: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

To run the codes from the reinforcement learning section, you would need to run these commands to install the necessary libraries:
pip install gym numpy
pip install gym
